# Minesweeper
This is a simple implementation of Minesweeper with a basic GUI. The game is played by revealing cells on a grid, trying to avoid hidden mines. The game ends when all non-mine cells have been revealed, or when a mine is revealed. The player can mark cells as mines to help avoid them.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library

## How to play
Run the runner.py file in a terminal or command prompt window.
Click the "Play Game" button to start the game.
Left-click on a cell to reveal it.
Right-click on a cell to mark it as a mine.
Continue until all non-mine cells are revealed or a mine is hit.

## AI agent
An AI agent is also implemented to play the game automatically. To use the AI agent, click the "AI Move" button, and it will make a move for you.

##How to customize the game
You can modify the game settings by changing the values of the HEIGHT, WIDTH, and MINES variables in the runner.py file.

Have fun playing Minesweeper!
